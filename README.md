# Among Us TODOs API

![Among Us banner](docs/img/banner.jpg)

Fake REST API server of tasks from Among Us

## Getting Started

This application is backed by the default data from a json file (default to be `db.json`, however it can be specified through an environment variable).
The underlying server that power the application is [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

### Starting the application

Simply `npm start` and the server will be started with the default configurations on port 3000 and db file to be `db.json`

### App-level configurations

- `DB`: path to the json file that will be used as the database
- `PORT`: port that the app will start on

### Testing

- Code linting: `npm run lint`
- Full test suite: `npm test`

## API Reference

Data from the json database file will be loaded every time the app starts and db writes will be made to the same file as well. Hence, a note on if the data is not commited into source, we might see differences between environments.

Listed below are basic usages of the API, more advanced usages can be found [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#routes).
